{"name":"Decoy","tagline":"jQuery plugin to make decoys for your elements.","body":"# Decoy (formerly Double)\r\n\r\n> jQuery plugin to make decoys for your elements.\r\n\r\nEver wished to change an element's properties, style and behavior and instantly restore to what it was before the mess ?\r\nThat's what Decoy enables you to do. You make a decoy, change it, and then, eventually, restore the original.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar box = $('#box');\r\n\r\nbox.css('background', 'black'); // We set its background to black\r\nbox.decoy().css('background', 'red'); // Now it has a red background, but we are actually looking at its decoy\r\nbox.restore(); // Here we recover the original, restoring its background to black\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe method `decoy()` is a reference to the element's decoy. You can chain multiple calls just like you do with regular jQuery objects. That's because it is a regular jQuery object.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nbox.decoy().text(\"Hello, I'm a decoy!\").css('font-size', '48px');\r\nbox.decoy().text(\"I do dangerous stuff for you.\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhatever changes you've done to its decoy, it will be undone when you restore the original. All styles and bindings, everything back to what it was before the first time you called `decoy()` on it.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\nThe plugin has been renamed to **Decoy** since *double* is a reserved word and would cause trouble in the future.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nLicensed under [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
